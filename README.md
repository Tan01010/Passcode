# Requirements
To be able to make this app work, you need to have a couple of files. Here are the files that you will need:
# pass.txt
# log.txt
The pass.txt file needs to contain the passcode on the very first line. You can have random other text on the other lines. In the log file, you will be able to see what people have been typing for the passcode.(So that people won't be doing inappropiate words/codes)

Happy Coding!
